The first query is for exploratory purposes. The code is the first set of SQL code in the decided views file. 

For clarification:
  * total_rows = the total number of rows in that were submitted
  * total_services_counts = the total number of all the services that were provided
  * total_distinct_codes = the total number of distinct HCPCS codes that were provided
  * total_distinct_providers = the total number of distinct NPI in the submissions
  * total_submitted = the total amount of money that providers submitted to Medicare for payments
  * total_allowed = the total amount of money that Medicare agrees that the beneficiaries were responsible for
  * total_paid = the total amount of money that Medicare paid to the providers
  * participating = accepting Medicare designated payments
  * nonparticipating = not accepting Medicare designated payments

Summarization:
  * total amount that Original Medicare Part B paid for Physicians and Others in the year 2022 was $89,029,606,711.96, which was
    about 9% of the total Medicare spending in the year 2022. This amount came from 1,147,953 individual providers.
  * The counts of total and participating are almost the same, only a minimum amount of all submissions were from providers that 
    did not accept the Medicare designated payment


# 2 - Spending per State

![alt text](https://github.com/piepiepies/2022partBphysiciansothers/blob/main/payment%20state.PNG?raw=true)

This table was generated with the second set of SQL code from the decided views file. The focus on the total amount that was paid
to each state through Medicare Part B for the phyisicians and others services, the average amount between all the states, and the median amount.

The top 4 states in terms of total payment are California, Florida, Texas, and NY in descending order.
Through this query:
````sql
SELECT
	TOP 4
	provider_state,
	ROUND(state_total_paid/1000000000, 2) AS total_paid_in_billions,
	ROUND(avg_total_paid/1000000000, 2) AS national_avg_in_billions,
	ROUND(median_total_paid/1000000000,2 ) AS national_median_in_billions
FROM state_information
ORDER BY state_total_paid DESC
````
|provider_state          |total_paid_in_billions|national_avg_in_billions|national_median_in_billions|
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
|CA                      |10.67                 |1.74                    |1.02                       |
|FL                      |8.32                  |1.74                    |1.02                       |
|TX                      |6.47                  |1.74                    |1.02                       |
|NY                      |6.24                  |1.74                    |1.02                       |


You can see how each of the 4 states total payment amount compares to the national average and national median.
California's total paid amount was over 10 times the national average state paid amount amongst the states.


A quick query of the sum of total paid amounts of the top 4 vs. another sum of the rest shows that with the rest of the states.
````sql
SELECT
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN provider_state IN ('CA', 'FL', 'TX', 'NY') 
		THEN (state_total_paid)/1000000000.00 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS top_4_total_in_billions,
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN provider_state NOT IN ('CA', 'FL', 'TX', 'NY') 
		THEN (state_total_paid)/1000000000.00 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS the_rest_total_in_billions
FROM state_information
````
|top_4_total_in_billions |the_rest_total_in_billions|
|------------------------|--------------------------|
|31.71                   |57.22                     |
